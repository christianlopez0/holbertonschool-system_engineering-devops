Three-Server Web Infrastructure
Overview
This README provides an overview and setup instructions for a three-server web infrastructure designed to efficiently manage web traffic with enhanced scalability, reliability, and security. The architecture includes a load balancer, web servers, an application server, and a database server.

Architecture
Components
Load Balancer (HAProxy Cluster)
Web Server(s)
Application Server
Database Server
Detailed Component Description
1. Load Balancer (HAProxy Cluster)
Purpose: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple web servers to ensure even load distribution and improve fault tolerance.
Configuration:
Cluster Setup: Multiple HAProxy instances are configured in a cluster for redundancy. If one HAProxy instance fails, the other continues to handle requests.
Why: Provides high availability for the load balancing service and ensures efficient traffic distribution.
2. Web Server(s)
Purpose: Handles requests for static content and forwards dynamic content requests to the application server.
Why: By separating the web server from the application server, each component can be scaled independently based on specific needs. Web servers efficiently manage static content delivery.
3. Application Server
Purpose: Executes application code, processes business logic, and interacts with the database.
Why: Isolating the application server from the web server optimizes resource management and performance. It handles complex processing without affecting the web serverâ€™s performance.
4. Database Server
Purpose: Manages and stores application data, handles queries, and ensures data integrity.
Why: Hosting the database on a separate server isolates it from web and application servers, enhancing security and performance. Dedicated resources for database operations improve efficiency.
Setup Instructions
Load Balancer Configuration

Set up HAProxy instances and configure them to work in a cluster.
Implement load balancing algorithms (e.g., Round-Robin) to distribute traffic.
Web Servers Setup

Install and configure Nginx on each web server.
Set up static content serving and configure forwarding rules to the application server.
Application Server Setup

Deploy the application code base on the application server.
Ensure it can communicate with both the web servers and the database server.
Database Server Setup

Install and configure MySQL on the database server.
Set up replication if needed and ensure data integrity and security.
Considerations
Load Balancer Cluster:

Ensure proper synchronization and failover capabilities between HAProxy instances.
Monitor performance and adjust configurations as needed.
Web Servers:

Implement caching strategies to optimize static content delivery.
Regularly update and maintain server security.
Application Server:

Optimize application performance and manage resources effectively.
Ensure reliable communication with web servers and the database.
Database Server:

Implement regular backups and data replication for high availability.
Monitor database performance and security.
Troubleshooting & Issues
Load Balancer Issues:

Potential Issue: If one HAProxy instance fails, traffic may be disrupted if not properly handled by the cluster.
Solution: Implement health checks and automatic failover.
Database Write Bottleneck:

Potential Issue: A single MySQL Primary node handling all writes can become a bottleneck.
Solution: Consider database clustering or partitioning to manage load.
Component Overlap:

Potential Issue: Having all components (web, application, database) on the same server can complicate scaling and performance.
Solution: Distribute components across separate servers to manage resources more effectively.
This setup aims to provide a robust, scalable, and secure infrastructure for hosting your web application. Follow the instructions and considerations to ensure optimal performance and reliability.
